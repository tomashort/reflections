What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing a repository creates all the necessary files and file structures
that allow you to use git functions such as log, diff and checkout. Without doing
this you just have a normal directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is an abstract location containing all files in the working
directory that are also in the repository, or are intended to become part of
the repository after the next commit. The staging area allows the user full
control over what files become part of the repository.
