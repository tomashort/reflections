How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug
that was introduced?

By reducing the file to just the lines that are different between the two files.
By putting the two version of each different line next to each other, making
them easier to compare.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

You don't have to be scared of making mistakes; you can quickly and easily just
roll back to a previous version.
You don't need to keep multiple different versions in different places; there is
always one clear 'current' version.
You need to learn to document the changes you make, meaning you have to think
clearly about what you are doing.
---------------------------------------------------------

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like
Google Docs does?

Pros:
Ensuring you commit versions of your code that actually work (as far as you know!).
Avoids having too few or too many commits (of course it's up to the user what
constitutes too few or too many).
Encourages the programmer to think clearly about the development of their project.

Cons:
Some programmers may forget to commit.
---------------------------------------------------------

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Programming-orientated systems should off multi-file commits, as programming
projects usually contain multiple files which will be connected to some extent.
Making a logical change to a project will often require the programmer to make
changes to more than one file.
---------------------------------------------------------

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log displays a list of every commit in the history of that repository. git
diff can be used to compare two different versions of a file.
---------------------------------------------------------

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

Version control gives you the confidence that you will be able to find and fix
any errors that you introduce to your project.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Developing new Python projects!
