When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

If you need to work on the project on more than one computer.
If you are collaborating with one or more other programmers.
If you want your work to be available publicly.
If you want your work to be backed up online.
---------------------------------------------------------

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If the project is a collaborative effort between multiple developers, each
developer might wish to keep their work separate until a certain time
